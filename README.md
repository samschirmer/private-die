Private Die Demo - Mystic Ape Games

This is a super early digital demo of Private Die, a dice-rolling board game by Mystic Ape Games. This is purely CLI at this point, and for the foreseeable future. Works in Ruby 2.1.4 that I know of. 

This is going to be distributed (for free) to backers of our impending Kickstarter campaign to launch the physical version of the board game. 

7/22/2015:
I've added a couple more classes (Lucky and Insubordinate), and they've been tested to the point that they're stable. I still need to add a couple more classes to round out the basic game roster, but we still have to work out some rules kinks on the actual game development end. Once we have the final two detective abilities hammered out, I will add them to this digital version.

Still need to write the roll-off code to handle ties. 

7/17/2015:
First commit of the code. Right now, ties are handled (but do nothing), and only two character classes actually work (analytical and professional). The rules don't exist yet (in this digital copy of the game, anyway), and lots of readability cleanup/polish is needed.
