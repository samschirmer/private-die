Private Die Demo - Mystic Ape Games

This is a super early digital demo of Private Die, a dice-rolling board game by Mystic Ape Games. This is purely CLI at this point, and for the foreseeable future. Works in Ruby 2.1.4 that I know of. 

This is going to be distributed (for free) to backers of our impending Kickstarter campaign to launch the physical version of the board game. 

9/6/2015:
With our Kickstarter looming (two days from now), I had to get this finished up. There are some line spacing oddities every once in a while, but the game is quite playable in its currently state.
